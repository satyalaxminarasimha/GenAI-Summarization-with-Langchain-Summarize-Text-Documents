üìÑ‚ú® Custom PDF Summarizer with Gemini & LangChain A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that leverages the power of Google's Gemini-1.5-flash model via LangChain to generate custom summaries of PDF documents based on user-provided prompts.

üöÄ Overview This project provides a simple yet powerful interface for summarizing PDF files. Instead of a generic summary, users can provide a specific prompt (e.g., "Summarize this for a non-technical audience in five bullet points" or "Extract all key financial figures from this report") to guide the AI. The application handles document loading, text splitting, and interaction with the Gemini API through the LangChain framework.

‚ú® Features Upload PDFs: Easily upload any PDF document directly through the web interface.

Custom Prompts: Tailor the summarization task to your exact needs with a custom instruction prompt.

Powered by Google Gemini: Utilizes the fast and efficient gemini-1.5-flash-latest model for high-quality text generation.

Intuitive UI: A clean, sidebar-based layout built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

Secure API Key Handling: Uses a .env file to safely manage your Google Gemini API key.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Backend: Python

Web Framework: Streamlit

LLM Framework: LangChain

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation Follow these steps to run the application locally.

Clone the Repository Bash
git clone https://github.com/sathyam2003/GenAI-Summarization-with-Langchain.git cd GenAI-Summarization-with-Langchain 2. Create a Virtual Environment It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate

For Windows
python -m venv venv .\venv\Scripts\activate 3. Install Dependencies Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt 4. Configure Environment Variables The application requires a Google Gemini API key.

Create a new file in the root directory named API.env.

Add your API key to this file as shown below:

Code snippet

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE" You can obtain a free API key from Google AI Studio.
